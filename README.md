# NAC-_LAB_PROJECT

## Description
This repository contains the NAC Laboratory Project for the course on Neural Networks and Deep Learning. It includes implementations of simple neural network prototypes, using datasets such as the Penn Treebank dataset from Kaggle.

### Project Scope
- Developing a conceptual understanding of neural networks and the backpropagation algorithm.
- Implementing a simple prototype feedforward neural network with:
  - 1 input layer
  - 2 hidden layers
  - 1 output layer
- Training and testing using the preprocessed Penn Treebank dataset.

### Structure
- `Task_1/` : Contains code, data preprocessing scripts, and results for Task 1.
- Other folders will be added as separate tasks in future updates.

### Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SnitTeshome/NAC-_LAB_PROJECT.git
